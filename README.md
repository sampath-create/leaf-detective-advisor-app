## 🔧 How I Edit the Code

I've set things up to be super flexible, so I (or anyone contributing) can edit the project in a few smooth ways:

### 💡 Option 1: Use Lovable

Head over to the [Lovable project dashboard](https://lovable.dev/projects/9ccc702c-3d68-408a-9b14-3815632415cf) and start typing your prompts like magic. Any changes made here get automatically committed. Easy peasy.

### 💻 Option 2: Code in My Favorite IDE

Prefer working locally? Me too sometimes. Here's what I do:

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone <YOUR_GIT_URL>

# Jump into the project
cd <YOUR_PROJECT_NAME>

# Install all dependencies
npm i

# Fire up the dev server with live preview
npm run dev
```

All you need is Node.js & npm installed (recommend using [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating)).

### ✏️ Option 3: Edit Directly on GitHub

Just navigate to any file in the repo, hit that little ✏️ pencil icon, make your tweaks, and commit them. Simple and effective.

### 🌐 Option 4: GitHub Codespaces

If you love coding in the cloud:

- Go to your repo's main page.
- Click the green “Code” button.
- Hit the "Codespaces" tab.
- Spin up a new one and get right into editing.
- All changes sync up nicely once committed.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack I’m Rocking

This whole thing is built with some modern, clean, and powerful tools:

- ⚡ Vite
- 🧠 TypeScript
- ⚛️ React
- 🧩 shadcn-ui
- 🎨 Tailwind CSS

It’s fast, responsive, and super fun to work with.
